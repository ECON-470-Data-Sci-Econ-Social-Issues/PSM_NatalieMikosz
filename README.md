Replication from the article "Impact of early nutrition and feeding route on clinical outcomes of neurocritically ill patients"  using a simplified version of the PSM test run in the paper. 

Objective:
The study aimed to explore the relationship between early nutrition and clinical outcomes in patients admitted to a neurosurgical ICU.
It sought to identify the optimal timing, route, and formula for nutrition, with a focus on comparing early enteral nutrition (EEN) and early parenteral nutrition (EPN).

Methodology & Instrument:
Conducted as a retrospective single-center observational study at the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, South Korea.
Included patients from the neurosurgical ICU between January 2013 and December 2019, who were hospitalized for over 5 days due to neurocritical conditions or postoperative care.

Reason:
Nutrition support is critical in managing critically ill patients, impacting neurological prognosis and mortality, especially in those with stroke or traumatic brain injuries.
The study was driven by the need to understand the impact of early nutrition on such patients, given the potential benefits and the current uncertainties regarding the optimal nutrition strategy.

Data:
The study period saw 12,743 admissions, with 1,353 patients meeting the inclusion criteria for the final analysis.
Early nutrition was provided to 384 (28.4%) of these patients, with 152 (11.2%) receiving EEN and 232 (17.1%) receiving EPN.

Results:
Patients receiving late nutrition exhibited a higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to those receiving early nutrition (33.1% vs. 14.1%).
No significant difference in in-hospital mortality or infectious complications was observed between the late and early nutrition groups after adjusting for biases using PSM and PSOW.
EEN was notably associated with a lower rate of in-hospital mortality and infectious complications, suggesting its potential benefit in neurocritically ill patients.
